# How I Work - Claude Code Session Guide

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20

---

## Platform Structure

**Tenant → Team → Chatbot Hierarchy:**
- **Tenant:** Everyone in the same company (e.g., "Acme Pharma")
- **Team:** Department/group (e.g., "Quality Team", "Production Team")
  - **Admin role:** Can create and edit all chatbots in this team
  - **Consumer role:** Can use all chatbots in this team
- **Personal Team:** Each user's private workspace (only that user is member)
- **Chatbot:** Belongs to ONE team

**User Access:**
- Users can belong to multiple teams
- Always have a personal team (private workspace)
- Can move chatbot from personal → production team (soft launch workflow)

**Default Access Control:**
- Team members can access all team chatbots
- Non-members cannot see team chatbots (unless published to library or link-shared)

---

## Work Organization

**Work Streams** are ongoing categories; **Features** are finite deliverables.

**Priority Handling:**
- Priority managed via GitHub Projects custom field (P0-P3)
- Do NOT include priority in feature descriptions
- Custom field is single source of truth

---

## Communication Preferences

**Working Style:**
- ALWAYS do things automatically if technically possible
- Never ask "would you like me to..." - just do it
- Default to action, not questions
- Be maximally proactive and autonomous

**Information Delivery:**
- Present information directly in chat
- Don't just create files and tell me to open them
- Still create files for reference, but show content here first

**Feature Refinement:**
- Discuss and iterate in chat FIRST before updating GitHub
- Only update GitHub after content is finalized
- Exception: Non-feature work defaults to immediate execution

**Feature Titles (for Jens):**
- Use clear, descriptive titles (not fancy/marketing language)
- Use non-expert words that Jens (dev/tech lead) understands immediately
- Bad: "🎨 Productivity Suite Orchestration"
- Good: "🎨 HTML Apps for Custom Interfaces"
- Focus on WHAT it is, not marketing fluff
- Keep it simple and obvious

**Feature Format (for Jens):**
All features should follow this structure:

1. **What I Want (PO Wish List)** - Plain language explanation
2. **What It Should Do (MSP Capabilities)** - Checkable list items
   - Use `- [ ]` checkbox format for all items
   - Group by functionality sections
   - Example: `- [ ] Button: "Select Agent" opens modal`
3. **What's NOT in MSP** - Clear exclusions (future enhancements)
4. **Success Looks Like** - Measurable outcomes
5. **User Stories** - For reference
6. **Development Checklist (For Jens)** - Checkable task list
   - Organized by implementation area (UI, API, Logic, etc.)
   - Each item is concrete and checkable
   - Example: `- [ ] Create modal component`
7. **Technical Notes** - Detailed implementation info

## Session Recovery

When starting new session:
1. Check git log for recent commits
2. Review backlog files for current state
3. Read this HOW_I_WORK.md for methodology

## GitHub Workflows

### Creating Issues - CRITICAL Custom Fields

**ALWAYS set custom fields after creating any GitHub issue:**

Required fields: Type, Work Stream, Priority, AI Generated

**Process:**
1. Create issue via `gh issue create`
2. Get project item ID via GraphQL
3. Set all four custom fields via GraphQL mutations

  - "Verified": `d4c5f78e` (Fix verified, ready to close)
  - "Closed": `7fbd56b5` (Resolved and closed)

**Type Field:**
- Feature: Product features and capabilities
- Lead: Sales leads and business opportunities
- Bug: Defects and issues

**AI Generated Field:**
- Default for new issues: "Yes" (AI created/refined)
- User changes to "Human Assessed" when reviewed
- AI should NEVER change back to "Yes" unless explicitly instructed

### Sub-Issues

- Must inherit parent's work stream (both label AND custom field)
- Process: Create sub-issue → Add work stream label → Set custom field
- All sub-issues MUST have "sub-issue" label

### Closing Issues with State Reasons

**CLI Limitation:** `gh issue close --reason` only works on open issues

**Solutions:**
- **CLI Workaround:** Reopen first, then close with reason
- **GraphQL (Best for automation):**
  ```graphql
  mutation {
    closeIssue(input: {
      issueId: "issue_id_here"
      stateReason: NOT_PLANNED
    }) {
      issue { state stateReason }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Web UI:** Can change state reason directly

### Managing Duplicate Issues

**When closing duplicates, ALWAYS:**
1. Add the "duplicate" label to the closed issue
2. Close with explanation comment referencing the superseding issue
3. Add a comment to the active issue linking back to the duplicate

**Process:**
```bash
# Close duplicate with explanation
gh issue close 25 --repo Owner/Repo --comment "Closing as duplicate of #77..."

# Add duplicate label
gh issue edit 25 --repo Owner/Repo --add-label "duplicate"

# Link from active issue back to duplicate
gh issue comment 77 --repo Owner/Repo --body "This issue supersedes and closes #25..."
```

**Why this matters:**
- Creates clear audit trail showing issue relationships
- GitHub UI shows "duplicate" badge on closed issue
- Both issues link to each other for easy navigation
- Future searches find both issues and understand the relationship

## Strategic Priorities

**MSP Focus (Minimum Sellable Product):**
- Currently building toward first sale, not just MVP
- When discussing "next step" = what's needed to hit MSP
- MSP features must be production-ready and customer-facing quality

**Democratization & Scalability:**
- Challenge: Training/implementation resources shouldn't bottleneck growth
- Solution: Enable end users (process experts) to build their own chatbots
- Impact: Features enabling self-service creation are strategically critical
- Shareability work stream is key to scaling without proportional team growth
